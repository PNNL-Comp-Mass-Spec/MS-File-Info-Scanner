MS File Info Scanner Change Log

Version 1.1.3777; May 5, 2010
	- Added public function PostDatasetInfoUseDatasetID
		- Posts the Dataset Info to a stored procedure that takes DatasetID as the first argument

Version 1.1.3776; May 4, 2010
	- Updated to disable use of the acquisition time file (cache file) by default
		- To enable, use parameter line switch /CF or set option "UseCacheFiles" to True in the XML settings file
		- Removed switch /X
	- Updated to create TIC and BPI files, by default
		- Renamed switch /T to instead be /NoTIC
	- Added switch /LC, which enables creation of the 2D LCMS plots
		- By default, plots the top 100000 points
		- Can customize the max points to plot, e.g. /LC:50000
	- Now creating two versions of the LCMS plots
		- The first version has MaxPointsToPlot points
		- The second version has MaxPointsToPlot divided by LCMS2DOverviewPlotDivisor points
		- MaxPointsToPlot defaults to 500000 and LCMS2DOverviewPlotDivisor defaults to 10, and thus
		  by default the first set of plots has 500K data points while the second has 50K
		- If LCMS2DOverviewPlotDivisor=0, then the second set of plots is not created
		- Customize the divisor using /LCDiv at the command line or using "LCMS2DOverviewPlotDivisor" in the settings file
