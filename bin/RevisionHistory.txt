        - The StartTime column in the Frame_Parameters table should be represented by one of these values
        	- Integer between 0 and 1440 representing number of minutes since midnight (can loop from 1439.9 to 0); example: Sarc_MS2_26_2Apr11_Cheetah_11-02-18_inverse.uimf
        	- Integer between 0 and 60 representing number of minutes since past the current hour (can loop from 59.9 to 0); example: BATs_TS_01_c4_Eagle_10-02-06_0000.uimf
        	- A tick-based date, like 634305349108974800 (number of ticks since January 1, 0001); example: QC_Shew_11_01_pt5_c2_030311_earth_4ms_0001

Version 1.1.4139; May 2, 2011
	- Improved logic for determining AcqStartTime and AcqEndTime for .UIMF files
		- The DateStarted column in the Global_Parameters table could have:
			- A text-based date, like "5/2/2011 4:26:59 PM"
			- A text-based date, like "Thursday, January 13, 2011"
			- A tick-based date, like 129272890050787740 (number of ticks since January 1, 1601)
		- Similarly the StartTime column in the Frame_Parameters table could be represented by various numbers
			- Integer between 0 and 1440 representing number of minutes since midnight
			- A tick-based date, like 634305349108974800 (number of ticks since January 1, 0001)

		- If True, and if there is a problem reading a .Raw file, then will copy the file to the working directory, then try to re-read the file again
		- This used to be necessary when reading files from the NWFS Archive, but is no longer necessary
	- Fixed array indexing bug in clsFilterDataArrayMaxCount
	- Improved exception handling in clsLCMSDataPlotter
	- Added Status Message event to clsMSFileInfoProcessorBaseClass

		- The first version has MaxPointsToPlot points
		- The second version has MaxPointsToPlot divided by LCMS2DOverviewPlotDivisor points
		- MaxPointsToPlot defaults to 500000 and LCMS2DOverviewPlotDivisor defaults to 10, and thus
		  by default the first set of plots has 500K data points while the second has 50K
		- If LCMS2DOverviewPlotDivisor=0, then the second set of plots is not created
		- Customize the divisor using /LCDiv at the command line or using "LCMS2DOverviewPlotDivisor" in the settings file
